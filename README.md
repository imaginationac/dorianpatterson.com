As for the code to generate the site, I release unto the public domain. Should

### Branches

I use three major branches when developing.

- master: the live version of the site; static files (.html, .css, .js, and
  assets).
- source: stable branche of source files used to generate the site.
- develop: unstable branch used for development. Merges into source after a
  milestone
