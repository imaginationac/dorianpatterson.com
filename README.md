===========================================================

This is my personal landing page.
---------------------------------

There isn't much here at the moment, but if you feel like using anything, you 
can as long as you give proper credit.

I use Nanoc to generate the static files for the site. I use Haml for 
templating, Compass for styling, and Markdown for content. That's overkill for 
a single landing page, but I plan on adding more to the site.
