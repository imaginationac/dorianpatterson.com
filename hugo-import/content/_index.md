![Dorian Patterson, the owner of this website!](/img/dorian-patterson.jpg)

Hey, I'm Dorian Patterson. I make things with computers. Some examples: web sites and apps, video
games, the occasional beat, animation.

Formally, I have a background in Theatre. I studied a bit of computer science during my stay at the
University of Georgia. I'm comfortable with front-end web tech (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and some
back-end stuff too (PHP, Ruby, Node.js).

Feel free to contact me via any of the means below.
