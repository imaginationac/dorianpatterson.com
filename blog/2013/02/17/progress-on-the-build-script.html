I wanted to start with writing a build script that would automate the generation of the static files, run any tests (of which I currently have none) and deploy the site, all in one step if possible.</p>

<p>At the moment I&#8217;ve have a very simple Rakefile. In researching how I was to go about writing the tasks, I read up on the Kernel module, which has the <a href='http://http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Kernel.html#method-i-system'>system</a> method. Very handy, though whether or not it is a good practice is something that remains to be seen.</p>

<p>I also wanted to try writing tests for my rake file, but I&#8217;m still having trouble wrapping my head around writing tests in general. I&#8217;ll get to that, on the next release.</p>

<p>Also in my research I came to the subject of virtual machines (VMs) and provisioning as way of creating and isolating a development environment.</p>

<h2 id='vagrant'>Vagrant</h2>

<p><a href='http://www.vagrantup.com'>Vagrant</a> is an interface to <a href='http://www.virtualbox.com'>VirtualBox</a> that allows provisioning of VMs with various tools like <a href='http://www.opscode.com/chef/'>Chef</a> or <a href='http://puppetlabs.com/puppet'>Puppet</a>. The idea is nice, but the set up and execution unfortunately have failed in some aspects. VirtualBox&#8217;s shared folders suffer from severe performance degradations, but that was easy enough to solve by using a <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System_(protocol'>Network File System</a>) service. Unfortunately, I had issues with <a href='http://middlemanapp.com'>Middleman</a>: editing a file locally while the Middleman server is running wouldn&#8217;t register changes with Middleman itself. I worked around this by mounting the shared folder with <code>sshfs</code>, but that seemed to lead to more issues, and while trying to suspend the VM, the terminal completely locked up. I had to restart my physical machine.</p>

<p>So for the moment, I&#8217;ll be passing on using a VM to develop.</p>

<h2 id='middleman_blog_extension'>Middleman Blog extension</h2>

<p>There&#8217;s a <a href='https://github.com/middleman/middleman-blog/issues/94'>bug</a> when using the middleman-blog extension. If you don&#8217;t explicitly specify your timezone in the configuration file <code>config.rb</code> via <code>Time.zone</code>, the extension will complain about the date in the filename and the date in the frontmatter not matching.</p>

<p>I think a fix is on the way, but either way, it might be prudent to just require setting the time zone.</p></article></section></div><footer><p>&copy; 2013 Dorian Patterson.</p><p>The source for this site is available on <a href="https://github.com/imaginationac/imaginationac.github.com">Github</a>.</p></footer></body></html>
