Hey, I'm Dorian. I make things with computers. Some examples: web sites and 
apps, video games, the occasiona beat, very poorly drawn art, adnimation.

Formally, I have a background in Theatre. I studied a bit of computer science 
during my stat at the University of Gerogia. I'm comfortable with front-end web
 tech (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and some back-end stuff too (PHP, Node.js).

Feel free to contact me via any of the means below.
