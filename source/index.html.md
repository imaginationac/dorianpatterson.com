Hey, I'm Dorian. I make things with computers. Some examples: web sites and 
apps, video games, the occasional beat, very poorly drawn art, animation.

Formally, I have a background in Theatre. I studied a bit of computer
science during my stay at the University of Georgia. I'm comfortable
with front-end web tech (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and some back-end stuff
too (PHP, Node.js).

Feel free to contact me via any of the means below.
